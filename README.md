MYSQL Navigator
===============

This is a tiny but useful bash utility to navigate MySQL databases from the command line.
It is a wrapper around the `mysql` command line client, and it provides a few useful features: 

- **Auto-completion**: it auto-completes table names, column names, and SQL keywords.
- **FK References**: it helps you navigate into related records by showing references.

Sample usage:

Setting it up:

    ```bash
        $ ./mysql-navigator myconnection mydb mytable
    ```

    ```bash
        $ ./mysql-navigator myconnection mydb mytable
    ```
